# Asset Compilation Boilerplate
Simple boilerplate project to start using webpack/gulp.

This boilerplate includes:

- SASS/SCSS + autoprefixer
- Webpack
- Babel

## Build Scripts

`yarn run dev` watches files for changes. JS is compiled with source maps.

`yarn run prod` compiles assets once. Both SASS and JS are minified.
